# üì¶ Creating GitHub Releases for Junktoys

## Quick Build for Release

Run this command to create a release-ready portable package:

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

This creates a self-contained folder at:
```
bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\
```

## Creating a Release Package

### Option 1: Automated (Recommended)

Run the build script:
```powershell
.\build-release.ps1
```

This will:
- Build the app
- Create a `Junktoys-v1.0-win-x64.zip` file
- Ready to upload to GitHub Releases

### Option 2: Manual

1. **Build the app:**
   ```powershell
   dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
   ```

2. **Create ZIP file:**
   - Navigate to `bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\`
   - Select all files
   - Right-click ‚Üí Send to ‚Üí Compressed (zipped) folder
   - Rename to `Junktoys-v1.0-win-x64.zip`

3. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repo
   - Click "Releases" ‚Üí "Create a new release"
   - Tag: `v1.0`

**No installation required!** Users just:

- Consider creating a separate "lite" version without language packs to reduce size

That's it! Your app is now ready for GitHub Releases. üöÄ
