Before building, you need the .NET 8.0 SDK:

1. Download from: **https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0**
2. Run the installer (choose SDK, not Runtime)
3. Restart your terminal/PowerShell after installation
4. Verify installation: `dotnet --version`

## Step 2: Build the Application

### Option A: Using the Build Script (Recommended)
```powershell
.\build.ps1
```

### Option B: Manual Build Commands
```powershell
# Restore packages
dotnet restore

# Build the project
dotnet build -c Release

# Create standalone EXE
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -p:PublishSingleFile=true -p:IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract=true
```

## Step 3: Run the Application

The compiled executable will be at:
